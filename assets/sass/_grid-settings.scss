Grid

This framework uses [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) to create a consistent 16 column responsive grid layout with good defaults.

Bourbon is a [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) mixin library (it provides little styling). Neat is a flexible grid framework.

Avoid mixing this layout with other grid layouts.

<p class="callout"><strong>Grid classes?</strong> There are no non-semantic grid classes with which to set block elements. This is intentional. If you need to add to or customise the grid system see below.</p>

The grid unit proportions, gutters and spacing are defined in `_grid-settings.scss`.

/*
Extending settings

If you need an element not defined here you are probably not the only one&mdash;please [log a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues) so we can provide it for everyone.

We define the grid placement for the following elements in `_block-elements.scss`:

- `header`
- `footer`
- `main`
- `article`
- `aside`.

To create your own element you will need to use the [Neat `span-columns` function](http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest/#span-columns).

For each new element you will need to manually set column properties for the breakpoints, from smallest to largest:
1. `$mobile`
2. `$tablet`
3. `$desktop`

/*
Margins & gutters

Maximum page width is set to 1200px. Gutters between the columns are a minimum of 32px.

```
$max-width: em(1200) !global;
$gutter: em(32);
```

Style guide: Grid.3 Margins & gutters
*/

$grid-columns: 4 !global;
$max-width: em(1200) !global;
$gutter: em(32);


/*
Breakpoints

This framework has a mobile-first default layout of 4 columsn, and adds 3
breakpoints for grid layout on larger screens:

- Default: 4 columns
- Mobile: 8 columns, 420px minimum
- Tablet: 12 columns, 768px minimum
- Desktop: 16 columns, 1200px minimum

If you give an element a modified grid setting consider the implications for all breakpoints. The Digital Service Standard recommends you [build using mobile first design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/).

Please also consider the [font size](section-typography.html#kssref-typography-2-headings-body-copy-1-breakpoints) at different breakpoints.

```
$mobile: new-breakpoint(min-width 420px 8);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(min-width 768px 12);
$desktop: new-breakpoint(min-width $max-width 16);
```

Style guide: Grid.4 Breakpoints

@import 'vendor/neat/neat-helpers';
$mobile: new-breakpoint(min-width 420px 8);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(min-width 768px 12);
$desktop: new-breakpoint(min-width $max-width 16);

/*
Layout

Primary content is always contained in 12 columns. This allows for seamless introduction of a sidebar / side navigation.

Style guide: Grid.5 Layout
*/

/*
Wrapper class

There is a wrapper class for escaping the outer (grid) container: `<div class="wrapper">`. This is currently used for the page `header` and `footer`.

Style guide: Grid.6 Wrapper class
*/

/*
Header & footer

The site header and footer are targeted by their ARIA roles, not a `class` or `id`. Use `banner` and `contentinfo` roles, respectively.

Style guide: Grid.7 Header & footer
*/

/*
Accessibility

Long lines reduce legibility. Lines of text should be no longer than 75 characters. Place text in narrower grid boxes to stop text lines from becoming too wide.

Low-vision users should be able to increase the size of the text by up to 200 per cent without breaking the layout.

Style guide: Grid.8 Accessibility
*/

/*
Debugging

Turn on the visual grid to help debugging:

```
$visual-grid: true;
```

See the example [Bourbon Neat working grid layout](http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/).

Style guide: Grid.9 Debugging
*/

// Toggle visibility of your grid columns for development/debugging.
$visual-grid: false;

$border-box-sizing: true;
$disable-warnings: true;

// Make sure you set the viewport to the device-width in your head, eg
// <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
