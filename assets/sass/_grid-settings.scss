Grid

This framework uses [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) to create a consistent 16 column responsive grid layout with good defaults.

Bourbon is a SaSS mixin library (it provides little, if any styling), while Neat is a flexible grid framework.

Avoid mixing this layout with other grid layouts.

<p class="callout"><strong>Grid classes?</strong> There are no non-semantic grid classes with which to set block elements. This is intentional. If you need to add to or customise the grid system see below.</p>

The grid unit proportions, gutters and spacing are defined in `_grid-settings.scss`.

Extending settings

If you need an element not defined here you are probably not the only one&mdash;please [log a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit/issues) so we can provide it for everyone.

We define the grid placement for the following elements in `_block-elements.scss`:

- `header`
- `footer`
- `main`
- `article`
- `aside`.

To create your own element you will need to use the [Neat `span-columns` function](http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest/#span-columns).

For each new element you will need to manually set column properties for the breakpoints, from largest to smallest:
1. `$desktop`
2. `$tablet`
3. `$mobile`

/*
Breakpoints

This framework uses 3 breakpoints for grid layout:

- Mobile: 4 columns, 420px maximum
- Tablet: 8 columns, 768px maximum
- Desktop: 12 columns, 1200px maximum

We are exploring using a fourth breakpoint: wide desktop.

If you give an element a modified grid setting consider the implications for all breakpoints. The Digital Service Standard recommends you [build using mobile first design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/).

Please also consider the [font size](section-typography.html#kssref-typography-2-headings-body-copy) at different breakpoints.
```
$desktop: new-breakpoint(max-width 1200px 12);
$tablet: new-breakpoint(max-width 768px 8);
$mobile: new-breakpoint(max-width 420px 4);
```

/*
Layout

Primary content is always contained in 12 columns. This allows for seamless introduction of a sidebar / side navigation.

*/

/*
Wrapper class

There is a wrapper class for escaping the outer (grid) container: `<div class="wrapper">`. This is currently used for the page `header` and `footer`.

Style guide: Grid.5 Wrapper class
*/

/*
Margins & gutters

Maximum page width is set to 16 columns centred, 1200px. Gutters between the columns are a minimum of 20px.

```
$grid-columns: 12 !global;
$max-width: em(1200) !global;
$gutter: em(20);
```

Style guide: Grid.6 Margins & gutters
*/

/*
Header & footer

The site header and footer are targeted by their ARIA roles, not a `class` or `id`. Use `banner` and `contentinfo` roles, respectively.

Style guide: Grid.7 Header & footer
*/

/*
Accessibility

Design for small screens first. Optimise for larger sizes, but do not assume you know which devices people are using.

Long lines reduce legibility. Lines of text should be no longer than 75 characters. Place text in narrower grid boxes to stop text lines from becoming too wide.

Low-vision users should be able to increase the size of the text by up to 200 per cent without breaking the layout.

Style guide: Grid.8 Accessibility

/*
Debugging

Turn on the visual grid to help debugging:

```
$visual-grid: true;
```

See the example [Bourbon Neat working grid layout](http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/).
