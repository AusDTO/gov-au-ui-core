<!-- # `gov-au-ui-kit` -->

## Welcome to the Guide

This is a draft guide for the use of a growing, lean, and frugal CSS/SCSS framework. It is meant to help build an accessible standardised look and feel for GOV.AU projects. We happily welcome use outside of federal government as well.

This is just the beginning; a work and progress that will develop with your help.

## How is this related to the Digital Service Standard?

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/) requires teams to [build services using common design patterns](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/). This is draft work on the framework and guidance that will eventually become the design patterns for digital content.

You should use this with the [draft **Content Style Guide**](http://content-style-guide.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/) for Digital Transformation Office projects.

## Roadmap

### Sprint 26 (Last sprint)
With the release of the MVP, the team took their product into usability testing to find areas to improve and iterate on. Additionally, the framework has expanded to include:
- list views
- footers
- tables
- type updates
- “skip to content” for screen readers


### Sprint 27 (Current)
The team has converted feedback and insights from usability testing into the following action points:
- Creating a separate "Getting Started" page
- Overall improvements to IA structure within the side navigation and inline anchor links

The framework is also expanding to include
- global navigation
- inline navigation
- layout patterns


### Where to learn about UI Kit releases

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

We aim to provide stable, usable releases at the end of each sprint.
