# `gov-au-ui-kit`

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit)

## What is this?

UI Kit (`gov-au-ui-kit`) is 3 things:

1. a draft design guide to build an accessible standardised look and feel for GOV.AU projects: [gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au](http://gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/)
2. common-use templates (to come)
3. a lean and frugal CSS/SCSS framework (found in `assets/sass/`) that you can
  - link to as a precompiled minified file:
  ```
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/latest/ui-kit.min.css"/>
  ```
  - download and include the complete SCSS framework in your asset pipeline to use the inbuilt mixins/extends for prototyping and building:
  ```
  https://gov-au-ui-kit.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/latest/_ui-kit.scss
  ```

### Features & browser support

- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
- Bourbon, version 4.2.7.
- Neat, and settings for a grid framework with some good defaults.
- Basic styling for content with some good typographic coverage.
- Basic styling for UI elements (eg `input`, `label`, etc.).
- UI components build on solid HTML foundation.
- Built on a [philosophy of progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) (as opposed to [graceful degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance)).

## What this isn't

This is not yet a complete design or design system. This is the starting point that will develop with your help.

## Who is this for?

Teams building Australian Government sites. This was designed for GOV.AU teams, but we welcome use outside of federal government.

## How is this related to the Digital Service Standard?

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/) requires teams to [build services using common design patterns](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/). This is draft work on the framework and guidance that will eventually become the design patterns for digital content.

You should use this with the [draft **Content Style Guide**](http://content-style-guide.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/) for Digital Transformation Office projects.

## Build the SCSS yourself

We have a build process for the development of the framework which uses gulp on node.js.

To build it yourself, begin by installing the system dependencies:
- Node.js v5.0.0

Install node package dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run a build:

```
gulp
```

The style guide can now be found at `./build/index.html`

We have automated the build, with a few additions:

- `sass-lint` for [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))
- `kss-node` for auto-building a living style guide: http://warpspire.com/kss/

This is available as a shell script at `bin/cibuild.sh`.

### Dependencies

We use Bourbon 4.2.7. We include its `.scss` files directly rather than calling it via its node (or gem) package. Bourbon and Neat live under `/assets/sass/vendor`.

Some of the key libraries we use are:
- `gulp ^3.9.1`
- `gulp-sass ^2.3.1`
- `kss ^3.0.0-beta.14`
- `sass-lint ^1.7.0`

`^` = compatible with version (see [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004)).

## Project goal

This framework is in active development.

Goal: build a lean and frugal CSS/SCSS framework to make building GOV.AU easier. It should:

- provide base consistency
- allow for easier rapid prototyping directly in the browser
- shouldn't get in the way of customised design needs.

### Releases

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

We aim to provide stable, usable releases at the end of each sprint.

### Deprecation

We are wary about breaking changes. We will work to ensure we will gracefully deprecate any changes that cause things to break.

### Installer/wrapper

We may create an installer wrapper (likely node-based), or release via git submodules.

## Milestones

### 1st general goal

Meet the general look and feel of the [gov.au alpha](http://gov.au/alpha), with room for some improvements.

This will allow us to establish the basics of the framework while meeting a relatively easily met static target.

We are focused on:

- establishing the basic framework
- provide UI styling for `input`, `label`, etc.
- styling for other buttons, next/previous, etc.
- some sane basics for high level block elements inc. `main`, `article`, `header`, and `footer`
- styling for primary and secondary `nav`.

### Futureâ€¦ (coming roadmap)

Iterate in 2 ways:

- look and feel under the direction of the designers from the GOV.AU Guides team
- styling for commonly used and requested things that builders from other Digital Transformation Office teams need, including:
  - styling for calendars
  - styling for common web application elements
  - extensive testing
  - templates.
